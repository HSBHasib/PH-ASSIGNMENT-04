### 1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
```js
• Genarally, these 4 methods are do same work to select any element from html document but these are used in different types of selection. 

• GetElementById is used to select a single element in the html document based on id attribute.
it is used to select id which is unique name in html document.

• GetElementsByClassName is used to select multiple elements in the html document based on class attribute.
GetElementsByClassName html collection of all elements that we selected based on class name.

• QuerySelector is also used to select a single element in html document
but one big and important difference between getElementById and querySelector is that querySelector just like css selector
we can select any element based on id, class, attribute even just element name.
One Important thing is that querySelector is just select the first element that matches the selector.

• QuerySelectorAll is used to select multiple elements in the html
it return a node list of all the elements that we selected based on the name.
Mainly we use it for multiple selection.
